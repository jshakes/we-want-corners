# We Want Corners!

Web pages are built with boxes. Boxes with corners so sharp you could cut your finger on them. But increasingly, web designers are eschewing this angular order. Instead they are lured by the siren-call of the 'squircle', that freakishly amorphic monogon that sits, Frankenstein-like, between oblong and elipse.

We Want Corners is a browser extension that stems the tide of softened, babyproofed web designs. Banish the tyranny of `border-radius` and restore crisp, beautiful angles to your browsing experience.
