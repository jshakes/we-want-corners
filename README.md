# We want corners!

Webpages are built with boxes. Boxes with corners so sharp you could cut your finger on them. But increasingly, web designers are eschewing this angular order. Increasingly they are lured by the siren-call of the dreaded 'squircle', that freakishly amorphic monogon, and the web is the poorer for it.

We Want Corners is a browser extension that stems the tide of softened, babyproofed web designs. Banish the tyranny of `border-radius` and restore crisp, beautiful angles to your browsing experience.
